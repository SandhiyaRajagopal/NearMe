                    A depot is a transport systemâ€™s operating base. It provides parking accommodation, servicing and maintenance facilities for vehicles, an administrative function, and facilities for staff. 
                    A fully enclosed depot is sometimes referred to as a garage. An operator may have one depot or several, depending on its fleet size or geographic coverage. 
                    Most transport operators have their head offices at one of their depots. Operators with fleets of more than two or three vehicles should have the use of off-street depot facilities. 
                    A small operator will normally have facilities for only very basic servicing. The larger the operator, the greater is the scope for carrying out maintenance work in-house at the depot.
                    
                    The principal operational tasks to be carried out at a bus depot are:
                    
                    Allocating buses and crews to each duty.
                    Dispatching buses according to schedule.
                    Processing cash paid in by conductors or drivers.
